Data Structure and Paradigm Choice (delete all but one):
  * Imperative binary-search tree
  * Pure-functional binary-search tree
  * Imperative hash table, with "separate chaining"/"external chaining"
  * Something else (must get approval from the professor before actually trying this)

References consulted (book, websites, etc.; see assignment for details)
  * Note you don't have to list Dive Into Systems, even if you use it
